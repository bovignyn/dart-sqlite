This is a fork of [Sam McCall's dart-sqlite
library](https://github.com/sam-mccall/dart-sqlite), updated so that
all the tests pass on my machine (64-bit Linux) as of 20 May 2013.  I
was in a bit over my head and changed things I don't quite understand;
I claim nothing other than that the tests now pass on my machine.  Use
at your own risk.
